/*
This problem is a variant of Next Greater Element I. 
In that problem, 
you are required to find the first next greater element while in this problem you are required to find the index difference 
from the current element to the first next greater element.
Let's put it simple with an example. Suppose temperatures = {60, 59, 61}, 
in Next Greater Element I, the next greater element for 60 is 61. So you will return 61 for 60. 
In this problem, you will return the index difference of the next greater element instead: 60 is at index 0 and 61 is at index 2, 
so you will return 2 - 0 = 2 for 60.
So by modifying the return values of Next Greater Element I, you will get the following solution.*/
